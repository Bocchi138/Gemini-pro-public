Thank you for contributing!
Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:
- Discuss first. It's always better to open a feature request issue first to discuss with the maintainers whether the feature is desired and the design of those features.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
- Check that there isn't already a PR that solves the problem the same way to avoid creating a duplicate.
